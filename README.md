Database management for CAC's payloads.

The code for the Spring 2023 payload is at : https://github.com/BinaryMongoose/Payload_Spring2023

We successfully launched 3 payloads about 110,000 feet into the atmosphere. 
One payload was carrying Three Sisters seeds from Dine' college. 
The Payload I worked on recorded GPS location, temperature, UV, and acceleration data on all axes. 
The final payload recorded 3 hours of video. 

The payloads weighed, in total, 5 pounds.
